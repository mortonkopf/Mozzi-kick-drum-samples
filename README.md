# Mozzi-kick-drum-samples
collection of .h files for Mozzi arduino audio library

just some very low-fi kick drum samples to use with Mozzi audio lirary for arduino.

these are converted from RAW using 8bit, not the usual 16bit, so that I can fit more samples onto the Teensy 3.2 board.

Dont expect super sound quality, its made to fit into a very small microcontroller.
